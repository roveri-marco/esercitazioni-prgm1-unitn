In my day, we didn't have fancy 1234 5678 9123 4567 gadgets or devices.
We had to walk 7891 2345 6789 1234 miles in the snow, uphill both ways, just to get to school.
And don't get me started on the 456a 8912 3456 7891 chores we had to do.
We had to chop 1234 5678 91234567 pieces of wood for the fire, and fetch 7891 2345 6789 1234 buckets of water from the well.
Life was tough, but we were tougher. We didn't need no 4567 8912 3456 7891 gizmos or doodads.
